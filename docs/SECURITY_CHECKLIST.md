# SQL Injection Security Checklist

**Audit Date:** 2026-06-25  
**Scope:** `backend/src/routes/` and `backend/src/controllers/`  
**Auditor:** Automated scan + manual code review  
**Method:** Searched for `query()` calls containing template literals with `${` interpolation; verified whether each interpolated value originates from user-controlled input (`req.body`, `req.params`, `req.query`) or from hardcoded/validated sources.

---

## Audit Summary

| Finding | Count |
|---|---|
| **Confirmed SQL Injections Fixed** | 4 |
| **Safe Patterns (Dynamic SQL, non-user input)** | Many |
| **Files with No SQL / Clean** | 34 |

> **Phase 8 Update (2026-06-26):** Three additional string-interpolation SQL injection vectors were discovered and fixed in `orderSheetController.js` during continued audit: `getOrderSheetSummary`, `exportFactoryAssignment`, and `getFactoryCapacity`. See below.

---

## Vulnerability Fixed

### 🔴 FIXED — `controllers/orderSheetController.js` — `getFilterOptions`

**Lines 1134–1145 (before fix)**

```js
// UNSAFE — companyId was interpolated directly into the SQL string
const wherePrefix = companyId ? `WHERE os.company_id = '${companyId}'` : '...';
await req.db.query(`SELECT DISTINCT supplier_name FROM master_order_sheets os ${wherePrefix} AND ...`);
```

**Why this is dangerous:** Although `companyId` comes from the JWT token (via `req.companyFilter`), if the token-decoding middleware is ever bypassed or a poisoned token is crafted, this becomes a full SQL injection vector. Defense-in-depth requires parameterization regardless of the source.

**Fix applied:**

```js
// SAFE — parameterized query
let osWhereSQL = companyId ? 'WHERE os.company_id = $1' : 'WHERE os.company_id IS NULL';
let queryParams = companyId ? [companyId] : [];
await req.db.query(`SELECT DISTINCT supplier_name ... ${osWhereSQL} AND ...`, queryParams);
```

## ESLint Security Configuration

`eslint-plugin-security` has been installed and configured in `.eslintrc.json`. Run the linter at any time with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Key rules enabled:

| Rule | Severity | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `security/detect-sql-injection` | **error** | Flags template literal SQL queries |
| `security/detect-non-literal-regexp` | warn | Prevents RegExp injection |
| `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename` | warn | Prevents path traversal via dynamic filenames |
| `security/detect-object-injection` | warn | Flags unsafe bracket notation on user data |

## Recommendations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All injection vectors found were fixed. The following architectural guidelines should be adopted to prevent regressions:

1. **Never interpolate `req.companyFilter` into SQL strings**, even though it's JWT-derived. Always use `$1` parameterization. This is defense-in-depth — a compromised signing key would otherwise lead to SQL injection.

208. **`TABLE_MAP` / `TABLE_MAPPING` guard pattern is correct** — `lockController.js` and `masterDataController.js` correctly use a hardcoded allow-list with early validation. Continue this pattern for any controller that uses user-supplied type names to select a table.
209. 
210. **Dynamic `WHERE` builder pattern is safe** — building clause strings like `'WHERE company_id = $1'` as a string constant and appending to queries with a separate values array is correct. The interpolation risk only arises when a *value* is put in the string instead of a parameter slot.
211. 
212. **Run `npm run lint` as part of CI** — the ESLint security plugin will flag any new `query(...)` calls that contain template literals with `${` interpolation.

## Automated Test Coverage (Document Locking Chain)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The crown jewel of the system — the PI → EI → PL → ANX → IB → VGM → SI document locking chain — is now fully covered by automated integration tests using **Jest** and **Supertest**. 

**Test Implementation Details:**
- **File:** `backend/tests/integration/exportDocumentLockingChain.test.js`
- **Framework:** Jest (Test Runner) + Supertest (HTTP assertions)
- **Scope:**
  - Validates full PI → EI document conversion.
  - Generates PL, ANX, IB, VGM, and SI automatically.
  - Evaluates cascading lock constraints across all tenant documents simultaneously when EI is locked via `/api/lock/lock-document`.
  - Asserts strict rejection (`400 Bad Request` or `403 Forbidden`) on malicious modifications to locked dependency records.
  - Ensures accurate cascading release upon EI unlock.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automatically enforced on the `master` branch via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
